## Introduction to Jupyter Lab
A small problem:　ジュピタ or　ジュパイタ		

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter. It offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. Eventually, JupyterLab will replace the classic Jupyter Notebook after JupyterLab reaches 1.0.(now Version 0.31.8)

We plan to release JupyterLab 1.0 later in 2018. The beta releases leading up to 1.0 will focus on stabilizing the extension development API, UI/UX improvements, and additional core features.

Important features for me:
- All notebooks are opened in the same tab.(a good news for Chrome user)
- Dark theme is now available (extension is no longer needed)
- File tree: better file management
- New implementation with better performance:  opening a 1 trillion row by 1 trillion column csv (and effortlessly scrolling left and right across the columns)	
- Drag and drop cells
- Window docking system with live preview

Easy to transfer from notebook to lab
- The notebook document is identical.
- The notebook server is identical.
